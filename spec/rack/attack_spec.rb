    # Rack::Attack stores request counts under cache keys that are computed based on the period and
    # the request identifier (for instance the IP).
    #
    # The cache key changes every x seconds (x = the chosen period), but we don't know when.
    #
    # Figuratively speaking we have a bucket (cache key) to throw balls (requests) into.
    #
    # We know that:
    # - The bucket can only hold 20 balls
    # - The bucket will be emptied (the cache key changed) every 2 seconds
    # - We are able to throw many more than 20 balls in 2 seconds
    #
    # Since we start throwing balls at an random point in time, there's no way to know when the
    # bucket will be emptied next. So it is not certain that throwing 21 balls at the bucket will
    # make it overflow.
    #
    # If we however throw 41 balls, we are sure to make the bucket overflow.
    # Even if the bucket is after we've thrown our first 20 balls, that still leaves 21 more balls
    # to fill the bucket afterwards
